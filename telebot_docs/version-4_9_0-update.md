# Version 4.9.0 Update

We're excited to announce the release of TeleBot Creator 4.9.0 with significant improvements to stability, performance, and functionality.

## Major Improvements

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

* Most of the previously reported bugs have been fixed in this release
* Improved stability across all components and libraries

### ⏱️ New Timing Controls

* Added native `time.sleep()` function with a maximum limit of 10 seconds
* Increased code execution timeout from 60 to 120 seconds
* Enhanced `run_after` command:
  * Maximum timeout extended to 1 year (365 days)
  * Minimum timeout reduced to 0.1 seconds
  * Smart rate limiting: For ultra-fast commands (under 0.4 seconds), a limit of 5 executions within 5 seconds to prevent abuse
  * Increased maximum scheduled `run_after` commands per user from 20 to 100

### 💰 TON Integration

* Added comprehensive TON blockchain support through the new `TonLib` (see dedicated [TON Library Documentation](https://help.telebotcreator.com/ton-library-documentation))
* Features include wallet creation, balance checking, transactions, and more

### 🔄 Code Improvements

* Direct HTTP module usage is now recommended over `libs.customHTTP()`
* For handling inline queries and other update types, use the `/handler_<update_type>` command format

### ⚠️ Important Changes

* The `import x` statement should not be present in any user code
* Use built-in libraries and modules instead of external imports

## Documentation Updates

We've added new documentation pages:

* [TON Library Documentation](https://help.telebotcreator.com/ton-library-documentation): Complete guide to blockchain integration
* Updated examples and use cases across all documentation
